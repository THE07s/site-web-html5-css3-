## The Problem Weâ€™re Solving

Agriculture, the most vital industry in the global economy, faces numerous problems that can hinder productivity. Climate change is the biggest one, it has made it challenging to determine the optimal time for planting and harvesting crops, resulting in crop failure in many cases. This is exacerbated by Africa's severe water deficit, making effective water management techniques crucial for irrigation. But what we tend to usually forget is the poor resource management - including water and fertilizers - which is a leading factor affecting agriculture. And environmental degradation, particularly soil erosion is linked to it. Excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has diminished soil fertility and productivity.\
     Labor shortages also pose operational difficulties, which can be minimized through automation and providing guidance to farmers for more critical tasks. Furthermore, many farmers do not embrace modern farming technologies that could enhance productivity and sustainability.\
    Unfortunately, we currently cannot address the economic aspect of starting a farm. Small-scale farmers in Africa face the challenge of high input costs for seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, which greatly affects them.\
    However, leveraging technology enhances efficiency, sustainability, and economic outcomes, and might announce a brighter future for farming.

## Key Features and Benefits

The AgriMapBot boasts several key features, making it an indispensable tool for agricultural management. Initially, the system produces intricate maps of fields, showcasing variations in temperature, humidity, and light. This enables farmers to create detailed field maps and receive tailored recommendations for optimal irrigation, as well as the necessary nutrients and fertilizers for the best yields. These capabilities are instrumental in enhancing crop health and productivity while minimizing fertilizer usage. Furthermore, all data and advice are readily available via a mobile app, which permits farmers to monitor the robot's progress, observe real-time data, and note changes and advancements over time. This facilitates effective and efficient farm management, revolutionizing agricultural methods and boosting crop productivity by aiding farmers in making well-informed decisions and keeping track of the robot's real-time progress.

Based on the data collected in the field, the AgriMapBot will also give advice on the most appropriate types of seeds, how to maintain them and, if necessary, how to protect them from pests inherent to these environments. This improves the sustainability of crops paving the way for a better future in agriculture.

## Technical Specifications<span style="color: #E00000"> </span>

The AgriMapbot uses a certain number of electronic elements to maintain this performance. Among these elements we can cite:

- an arduino Nano: which serves as support for the AgriMapBot code
- a GPS module: which helps in the creation of maps as well as in determining the current position of the AgriMapBot 
- A DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor: which allows you to determine the temperature as well as humidity levels -Photoresistors allowing the level of brightness to be digitized 
- 3 ultrasonic sensors which allow the AgriMapBot to move while avoiding various obstacles 
- 4 Continuous Rotation Servos: which ensure the rotation of the wheels
- a roll of thin aluminum foil which will be used in the internal coating of the AgriMapBot -rolls of PLA which will be used for printing the main frame of the AgriMaoBot
- rolls of PC-PTFE which will be used in printing the protective shell of the AgriMapBot -a DIAMANTÂ® glass plate to protect the various sensors.

## Obstacles and Potential Problems

To align with the project's budget, we need to address some potential concerns. The durability of the robot's PLA chassis may be compromised by constant exposure to outdoor elements like sunlight, rain, and temperature changes. \
    Moreover, according to IP ratings, PLA may not protect sufficiently against dust and water ingress, which are common in agriculture. Outdoor electronic devices typically require a higher IP rating (e.g., IP65 or above) for full dust and water jet protection. \
    Additionally, PLA's impact resistance is lower than materials such as ABS or PETG, making it prone to cracking or breaking under mechanical stress, especially on rough terrain. Fortunately, the wheels can be easily reprinted. \
    Lastly, considering the significant electromagnetic interference (EMI) found in agricultural fields, adequate shielding of the robot's electronics is crucial to prevent malfunctions, since PLA doesn't offer EMI shielding.

## Possible Solutions

To resolve the problem due to the low resistance of the AgriMapBot to various external factors, several methods were taken into account but the most effective is the following. The external shell of the AgriMapBot will be covered with a PTFE plastic frame which is a type of plastic extremely resistant to temperature change (500Â°C/-200Â°C) and which is waterproof. The shell will also protect the AgriMapBot from dust and shock. However, the sensors will not benefit from protection in order to keep the data as accurate as possible. Instead, the temperature and light sensors will receive protection from a protective plate made of DIAMANTÂ®, a type of glass that is extremely clear and yet very resistant. The internal part of the PLA shell will be covered with a thin layer of aluminum foil to protect the device from the various EMI present in agricultural fields.

## Competitive Advantages

There are actually some agricultural robots available on the agricultural market. These include Bacus the winegrower robot, Dino the weeding robot, etc. The biggest advantage of the AgriMapBot over these other robots is its versatility, since it is easy to see that other robots specialize in only one type of area. This versatility is also due to the fact that the AgriMapBot is more of an advisor and field manager rather than an active worker. It is therefore possible to make the AgriMapBot work in collaboration with other robots.

The AgriMapBot also stands out for its small size, which makes it much less bulky than larger robots like FarmDroid or Oz . The AgriMapBot is relatively autonomous compared to other robots and is capable of working completely independently, only sending alerts if too large an obstacle is encountered. Its long battery life (more than 15 hours for a recharge time of only 6 hours) allows it to work on surprisingly large surfaces. Additionally, AgriMapBots features a beehive-like system that allows multiple units to work together to cover a larger area than a single unit could cover, in record time.

## Potential Applications or Uses

This information helps farmers determine the best times to plant their crops to maximize growth and yield. Constantly monitoring soil moisture levels, it ensures that crops receive the right amount of water, thus avoiding insufficient or excess watering. This improves crop health and product quality.
    Concerning fertilizer, necessary types and quantities of fertilizers are suggested by the system based on analyzes of nutrient levels in the soil. This targeted approach to fertilization helps improve crop growth while minimizing excessive use of chemicals, which can harm the environment.
    Once a potential threat is identified, the robot alert farmers via the mobile application. It also provide recommendations on applying specific pesticides or implementing other control measures. Early intervention can significantly reduce crop damage and losses.
    By accurately diagnosing crop and soil needs, the robot helps minimize the need for chemical fertilizers and pesticides. This not only protects the environment, but also ensures that the products are healthier and safer to consume.
